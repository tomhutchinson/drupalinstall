Drupal installation scripts for CentOS

WARNING: This script should ONLY be run if PHP, MySQL, and Apache are either not installed or completely clean installs.  If you have already set a root MySQL password, changed Apache configuration, or enabled non-standard PHP plugins, stop now.

Instructions:
- Be root
- Make sure git is installed (yum install -y git)
- Run "git clone https://git.psu.edu/tmh24/ssri-drupal.git"
- Change directory to "ssri-drupal"
- Run "./drupal.sh"

You can do an unattended (not-so-)silent install by running "./drupal.sh -s".

This script has been tested on Centos 6.5, but should work on any version of CentOS or RedHat 6.
